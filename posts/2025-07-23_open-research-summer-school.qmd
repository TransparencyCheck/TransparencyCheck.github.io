Cristian Mesquida gave a Papercheck workshop at the [Open Research Summer School](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/open-research-summer-school-2025) at King's College London.

He explained the rationale for automated checks, and walked the audience through some of the Papercheck modules. 

You can find the workshop materials on the Open Science Framework: [osf.io/y4s76](https://osf.io/y4s76).
