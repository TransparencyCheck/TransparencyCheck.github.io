Research Transparency Check serves people at universities and research institutes, academic journals, and funding agencies. We engage seven data communities for the development of transparency criteria, and checklists for documentation of these criteria specific to the most common sources of data used in the Social Sciences and Humanities.\n\nAccess an alpha version of Papercheck\nRead the grant proposal for Research Transparency Check\n\n\nMeet the core team\nThe core team of researchers for Research Transparency Check consists of René Bekkers (PI, VU Amsterdam), Daniël Lakens (co-PI and developer of papercheck, Technical University Eindhoven), Lisa DeBruine (developer and maintainer of papercheck, University of Glasgow), Cristian Mesquida (programmer and analyst, TUE), and two research assistants, Max Littel (VU) and Jakub Werner (TUE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRené Bekkers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniël Lakens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLisa DeBruine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCristian Mesquida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Littel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJakub Werner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency Check Launch Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-10-06\n\n\nRene Bekkers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory Blog Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-07-27\n\n\nDaniël Lakens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlasgow Seminar on Papercheck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025-07-25\n\n\nLisa DeBruine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nOlder news…"

    "text": "We have started the project with a series of blog posts introducing the software package called papercheck that forms the basis for the project.\n\nIntroducing Papercheck\nAutomatically Checking Journal Article Reporting Standards\nChecking Data and Code in Repositories\nRetrieving Planned Sample Sizes\nEasily Download OSF Files\n\nThe posts attracted attention of researchers primarily in the meta science community. We are exploring new collaborations and continue to look for similar initiatives, tools and verification data. If you know of any new developments we should know about, please let us know.\nOver the summer we will be developing and validating new modules for the software, focusing primarily on the field of experimental psychology. After the summer we will start with the deliberative conversations in other data communities."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn this talk, I will introduce Papercheck, a new tool that leverages text search, code, and large language models to extract and supplement information from scientific documents (including manuscripts, submitted or published articles, or preregistration documents) and provides automated suggestions for improvement.\nInspired by practices in software development, where automated checks (e.g., CRAN checks for R packages) are used to identify issues before release, Papercheck aims to screen scientific manuscripts to identify potential issues or areas for improvement and guide researchers in adopting best practices. It can also assist with processing large numbers of papers for metascientific enquiry."
