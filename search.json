We are exploring new collaborations and continue to look for similar initiatives, tools and verification data. If you know of any new developments we should know about, please let us know.\nOver the summer we will be developing and validating new modules for the software, focusing primarily on the field of experimental psychology. After the summer we will start with the deliberative conversations in other data communities."
